# Rockar Tech Test

## Set up

Please ensure you have [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) installed on your machine. 

You can then install the [nodeJS plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) for asdf:

```asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git```

cd into the project and install the version of Node required for this project with:

```asdf install```

You might have to do ```asdf install nodejs lts-hydrogen``` but who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I should probably check that before handing this over

To install all dependencies for the project, run

```npm install```
